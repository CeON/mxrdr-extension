importer.name=Crystallographic Information File (.cif \u2013 PDBx/mmCIF)
importer.description=Imports metadata from a .cif (PDBx/mmCIF) file.
importer.form.main.description=The importer collects data from .cif (PDBx/mmCIF) file, which could be uploaded by the user or downloaded automatically from RCSB PDB using the given PDB Id code. Either providing the structure symbol or uploading the file is mandatory. In case these two are provided only the uploaded file will be processed. 
importer.form.pdbId.input=PDB Id code
importer.form.pdbId.hint=For example: 6qky. The code has to be four characters long. The first character must be a numeral in the range 1-9, and the next three characters can be either numerals (in the range 0-9) or letters (in the range A-Z in the Latin alphabet, case-insensitive).
importer.form.cif.upload.component=.cif (PDBx/mmCIF) file
importer.form.cif.upload.hint=.cif (PDBx/mmCIF) file used for metadata extraction
importer.form.diffrn.id.input=Diffraction set id
importer.form.diffrn.id.hint=Id of diffraction set data to use
importer.form.validation.pdbId.or.file=Either the structure symbol or the uploaded .cif (PDBx/mmCIF) file must be provided
importer.form.validation.pdbId.wrong.format=Wrong PDB identification code. The code has to be four characters long. The first character must be a numeral in the range 1-9, and the next three characters can be either numerals (in the range 0-9) or letters (in the range A-Z in the Latin alphabet, case-insensitive)
importer.form.validation.file.wrong.extension=File must have .cif extension
importer.form.validation.not.file.or.not.existing=Not a file or file does not exist
